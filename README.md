# Django-Sidebar

Is a chromium-based extension to disable the sidebar and side-menu in the official website of [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/)

## Puprose

I've found the sidebar and version-switcher and the right side of the official website of [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/), quite distracting. Thus I made this simple extension to be able to make it appear/disappear whenever I want to.

## Installation

The extension is available on the Brave and Google Chrom browsers.

## Usage
**Extension disabled:**

**Extension enabled:**
